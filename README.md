- **Project Summary**: 
  - Abstract:
Cryptocurrencies have become a popular research subject in financial markets. Since they do not have the fundamental value of the currency, predicting the price of cryptocurrencies is an important and complex question. Based on the literature, we find that social media sentiment is an important indicator of driving cryptocurrency price movements. For example, more positive tweets are associated with higher cryptocurrency value. However, existing research on cryptocurrency price prediction has mainly focused on the two main currencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, and has not extended to other tokens. Therefore, our study will focus on Aave, a native utility token of a top-one decentralization finance application on Ethereum, using social sentiment analysis to explore how tweets predict the price of Aave. First, we apply the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) to quantify the sentiment polarity (positive/negative) and sentiment intensity (-1~1) of tweets. Also, the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is used to measure the volatility of Aave’s price. Finally, we use the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to predict Aave’s price with social sentiment scores.
  - Intellectual Merit: 
The research project is expected to contribute to combining the fields of combining cryptocurrency forecasting, social sentiment analysis, and econometric methods. In addition, it enriches the research on the Aave token by combining social sentiment with the prediction of Aave’s price for the first time, encouraging more exploration of this token.
  - Practical Impacts:
It has important practical implications to predict the value of Aave more accurately through social sentiment analysis. On the one hand, our results provide a reference for cryptocurrency investors to estimate future price volatility and calculate expected returns. On the other hand, policymakers can disentangle the forces behind cryptocurrencies to craft regulations and curb financial stability risks.
